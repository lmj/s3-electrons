This is an experimentally exhaustive list of minimal configurations of
electrons constrained to the 3-sphere, from 5 electrons to 24 electrons.

Configurations of other numbers of electrons are also included.

These may be viewed with 'topeviewer', an application found in the
'esve' software package.  Most files here contain (optional)
topeviewer data; press spacebar to cycle through the preset views.

Included is a description of each configuration's symmetry group and a
summary report of all configurations.  These were produced in part by
the 'symfind' software package.
